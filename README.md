# Google-ADK-Agent-Multi_tool_agent

This is a simple project to test Google Gemini's ADK and its ability
to integrate multiple tools to answer user queries. The agent can retrieve weather
information and current time for specified cities, demonstrating how it can use different
tools to gather and process information to provide comprehensive answers to user questions.
For me as a developer, this project serves as a learning experience to understand how to build agents using the ADK
and how to integrate external API's to enhance the agent's capabilities.
It is also a staring point for building more complex agents that can perform a wider range of tasks and provide more detailed information to users.

# Libraries used:
    - datetime: For handling date and time operations.
    - zoneinfo: For working with time zones.
    - requests: For making HTTP requests to external APIs to retrieve weather and geocoding data.
    - google.adk.agents: For creating and managing the agent using Google's ADK

# Stack:
    - Python: The programming language used to develop the agent.
    - OpenWeatherMap API: An external API used to retrieve weather and geocoding data for the specified cities.
